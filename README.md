# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis  

An end-to-end Data Analytics project that analyzes customer shopping data to extract meaningful business insights using **Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project follows a complete data analytics pipeline:

Raw Data → Data Cleaning (Python) → PostgreSQL → SQL Analysis → Power BI Dashboard

The objective is to transform raw customer shopping data into actionable business intelligence.

---

## 🧹 Phase 1: Data Cleaning & EDA (Python)

**Tools Used:**
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

**Key Steps:**
- Handling missing values  
- Fixing data types  
- Feature engineering (e.g., converting purchase frequency into days)  
- Creating new analytical columns  
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Preparing structured data for database loading  

---

## 🗄️ Phase 2: PostgreSQL Integration & SQL Analysis  

The cleaned dataset was loaded into PostgreSQL using **SQLAlchemy** and **psycopg2**.

Business-driven SQL queries were written to answer practical questions such as:

- What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?  
- Compare the average purchase amounts between Standard and Express shipping.  
- Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on their previous purchases.  
- Which products have the highest discount usage?  
- Do subscribed customers spend more?  

This stage demonstrates structured querying and business analytics using SQL.

## 📊 Phase 3: Power BI Dashboard  

PostgreSQL was connected to Power BI to build an interactive dashboard for visualization and executive-level insights.

### Dashboard Highlights:
- Revenue breakdown by gender  
- Shipping type comparison  
- Customer segmentation analysis  
- Product performance insights  
- Subscription impact analysis  
- Age-group revenue contribution
